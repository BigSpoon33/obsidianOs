Over the years, I have done so many variations of sausage and potatoes on the stovetop with varying degrees of success. I have learned by now, for me and using my cookware/stovetop - I get the best results when the potatoes are parboiled. You don’t want them fully cooked but a heads start on them will work wonders. I parboiled the potatoes the night before so when I started this recipe, I followed in order as stated; I just didn’t need to cover the pan. I added a chopped onion and some shredded carrots leftover from another recipe. Simple yet hearty and good. The potatoes could use some seasoning - perhaps some all season salt - but not much because the sausage and onions/peppers add the flavors for you! Thanks Jeff!

My favorite version of this dish includes a small onion quartered and separated, 1 teaspoon of thyme, and 1/4-1/2 tsp black pepper. We only use green peppers, and never remove the kielbasa before adding potatoes, because the caramelized kielbasa and the “fond” it creates in the pan helps to flavor the entire dish! We use any kind of potatoes that are handy—Yukon golds, bakers, or even pre-diced “Simply Potatoes” and use our largest deep frying pan (covering it when the potatoes are added) so we can load it up, because it’s one of our favorite meals! There is just something about it that feels so festive, as if it’s like holiday or vacation fare! It’s really delicious!

Great beginner recipe. Love Kielbasa!! Added some diced red onions (had those on hand), 1 diced zucchini, and 1 finely diced carrot as I had no peppers on hand, 1 Tablespoon garlic which I added just after I added the potatoes along with 1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning. Sautéed it the Kielbasa until they were lightly browned then added the onion, zucchini and carrot. Added the seasonings and the garlic and Salt and Pepper to taste. Then, covered the skillet and simmered on low for 45 minutes until the potatoes were nice and tender. Checked and added about 1/4 water to deglaze any of the bits in the pan. With these changes - went from good to very good.

I read many reviews and decided to use ideas from a couple of them. I boiled my kielbasa for about 20 minutes to help get rid of some of the fat. I cut the peppers, some onion and potatoes into pieces approximately the same size. I tossed them all in olive oil and seasoned them with Mrs. Dash original seasoning. I put the potatoes on a sheet pan 1st as suggested by one reviewer In the oven at 375 and then added the peppers and onions after about 10 minutes. I browned the kielbasa in a cast iron skillet and added it to the vegetables. Right before the vegetables were done I added some grape tomatoes that needed to be used. It was delicious. There was a small amount leftover which I heated in the microwave and put an over easy egg on top for my lunch today. That was very good too.
