## 🛒 Ingredients

- 0.5 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 0.5 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 0.5 teaspoon dried oregano
- 0.5 teaspoon garlic powder
- 0.5 teaspoon onion powder
- 0.125 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 0.25 teaspoon ground coriander
- 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 0.5 lemon, juiced
- 1.5 cups water
- 1 cup dry couscous
- 0.5 cucumber, peeled and shredded
- 0.5 cup sour cream
- 0.5 cup Greek yogurt
- 0.5 lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 0.5 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 broccoli crown, cut into florets
- 1 medium red onion, diced
- 0.5 cucumber, peeled and diced
- 2 roma tomatoes, diced
- 0.5 cup chopped Kalamata olives, or to taste
- 0.5 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese, or to taste

## 🍳 Directions

1. Mix rosemary, black pepper, salt, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, cardamom, and coriander together in a small bowl. Place chicken on a plate and season with spice mixture. Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat until it starts to shimmer, 2 to 3 minutes. Add seasoned chicken to the pan and cook, covered, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip chicken over and cook, uncovered, until browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Squeeze lemon juice over chicken and allow to cool 5 minutes. Slice into strips.
2. While chicken cooks, bring water to a boil in a saucepan and add salt to taste. Add couscous, stir once, and cover. Remove saucepan from heat and let couscous steam for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
3. Mix cucumber, sour cream, yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, mint, dill, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until tzatziki sauce is just combined.
4. Divide cooked couscous between 4 bowls. Top with cooked chicken, tzatziki sauce, broccoli, onion, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, parsley, and feta cheese. Serve immediately or store in airtight containers to reheat later.
