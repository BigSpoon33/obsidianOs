It was a good base recipe. However, using fresh ingredients is a better idea. I used one teaspoon of fresh onions along with one teaspoon of fried onions. Then, I added two cloves of garlic, one teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of some chicken biriyani powder, a pinch of cumin, and two teaspoons of ginger paste. I also think dicing the chicken into small pieces lets the flavor get in better. Also, I think I will try using chicken broth, so there is more to eat with rice. I think this recipe is a great place to start and springboard off of with adjustments based off of personal tastes.

My finished dish looks MUCH different than all the others in the photos. But that's because I changed it around a bit. I used fresh garlic and onions. Cooked them until soft then added chicken. Added the seasoning salt but it wasn't enough. I will double it next time. Cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. I think I waited to long to add the chicken because the onions and garlic kind of cooked to nothing. You could taste them but not as much as it should have tasted. Added a can of cream of chicken soup and some chicken boullion granules...also a can of corn. Cooked til heated through then served over white rice. The finished meal was very tasty. We will make this again.

I made this at the start of my new low-calorie "no fast food diet"... and I loved it! It was super quick and easy - I'm a full time college student and my boyfriend works overnight so finding time to cook is pretty hard, but this took no time at all. I did follow the advice of some other users, and tossed a handful of chopped onion into the pan when right after melting the butter. I also used a lot more of the seasonings the recipe called for, in addition to red pepper flakes for a little bit more of a kick. All in all, I was super happy with how this recipe turned out and I'll definitely be making it again!
