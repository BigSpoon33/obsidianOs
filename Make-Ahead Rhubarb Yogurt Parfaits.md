## 🛒 Ingredients

- 2.5 cups chopped rhubarb
- 0.25 cup water
- 1 pinch salt
- 0.25 cup honey
- 1.25 cups graham cracker crumbs
- 1 (32 ounce) container vanilla Greek yogurt
- 5 tablespoons crushed walnuts

## 🍳 Directions

1. Combine rhubarb, water, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb has broken down, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in honey; cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Arrange five 12- to 16-ounce jars on a work surface. Place 2 tablespoons rhubarb mixture in the bottom of each jar; top each with 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs and each with ⅔ cup yogurt, in that order. Divide remaining rhubarb mixture and graham cracker crumbs among parfaits; top each with 1 tablespoon walnuts.
3. Seal jars; refrigerate until ready to eat.
