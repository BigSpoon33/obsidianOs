. The Physical Core (Your Picks)
# ​Toxicroak @ Life Orb
​Ability: Dry Skin
​Moves: Gunk Shot, Swords Dance, Sucker Punch, Close Combat
​The Role: Your primary setup sweeper. Under the Rain (provided by Politoed), Dry Skin heals 1/8th of your HP every turn. This effectively gives you a "free" Life Orb boost with no health penalty.
# ​Heracross @ Flame Orb
​Ability: Guts
​Moves: Facade, Close Combat, Megahorn, Knock Off/Trailblaze
​The Role: The Wallbreaker. While technically a beetle, Heracross fits the "bug-warrior" vibe perfectly. With the Flame Orb, his Attack reaches terrifying levels. Use him to punch holes in bulky teams so Toxicroak can clean up later.

​2. The Frog Support
# ​Politoed @ Damp Rock
​Ability: Drizzle
​Moves: Scald, Weather Ball, Encore, Rest/Helping Hand
​The Role: The Enabler. You need Politoed to set the Rain. This activates Toxicroak’s healing and weakens Fire-type moves that threaten Heracross and your Moth members. Encore is great for trapping opponents into non-damaging moves so your sweepers can switch in safely.

# Seismitoad @ Leftovers
​Ability: Water Absorb (or Swift Swim)
​Moves: Stealth Rock, Earth Power, Scald, Toxic
​The Role: The Tank/Hazard Setter. Every team needs a Ground-type to soak up Electric attacks. Seismitoad provides "entry hazards" (Stealth Rock) to chip away at the enemy, making it easier for Heracross and Toxicroak to get one-hit KOs.

​3. The Moth Specialists
# ​Volcarona @ Heavy-Duty Boots
​Ability: Flame Body
​Moves: Quiver Dance, Hurricane, Giga Drain, Fiery Dance
​The Role: The Special Sweeper. Volcarona is the "Sun" to Toxicroak's "Rain," but it actually works great here. In the Rain, Hurricane becomes 100% accurate. This gives Volcarona a massive power boost against other Fighting or Grass types that might resist your frogs.

# ​Iron Moth @ Choice Scarf
​Ability: Quark Drive
​Moves: Sludge Wave, Fiery Dance, Energy Ball, U-turn
​The Role: The Speedster. Since Toxicroak and Heracross are mid-speed, you need something that can outrun the fastest threats. Iron Moth provides incredible Special Attack and allows you to "pivot" out of bad matchups with U-turn
