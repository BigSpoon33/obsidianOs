what it is
how to get the most out
building a personal knowledge base (chat history, note taking app, google drive)
examples



2. explain what ai is
   What people think of as AI is actually just one part of AI or machine learning and the math has been around for a long time we just didn't have the compute to execute it.
	1. llm
	   large language models, basically a word calculator (no offense)
	2. use cases and examples
	   market research, re-writing emails or speeches, finding related topics, counseling, education, brainstorming
3. how to use it (ethics)
   don't just 'write an essay about x'
	1. garbage in garbage out
	   if human input is 0 ai output is 0. AI is a multiplier for human creations.
	2. not a replacement
	   don't let AI replace human thought and knowledge. AI is already a useful tool and advancing fast. but that doesn't mean you don't have to know your profession in and out. especially when you're trying to sell something or explain it to someone who is interested. don't get caught going 'uhh idk when asked a question.'
	3. do it yourself first even if just an outline (human in the loop)
	   expand on the concept of trans humanism, not replacement. the first steps of a project start with chicken scratch and brainstorming. get your ideas together even if it's unstructured. just start writing.
	4. AI tools (brief explanation, covered more in next tutos)
	   things like agents are used to give AI autonomy and workflows are used to send an input through a sequence of steps. think of agents like AI personalities for example a librarian or market researcher or project manager. workflows are like repeatable step by step instructions
4. following the cycles
   AI moves fast, it's the focus of tech development right now, and there is always something new to try. don't get caught up chasing every shiny object.
	1. the cycle of sota (define sota)
	   There is always a newer, bigger model on the horizon. stay calm and weather the storm. sometimes it's better to wait a week to a month before trying things. let other people be the first cycle of testers then adapt to new technology as it fits your profession.
	2. don't get lost in the hype
	   There are so many new tools (shiny objects) coming out. it feels like every day there is something new to try. get to a functional state of your use and build on that as new tools become available. look for things you need, use, fit your niche.
	3. follow the news (reddit) can be good and bad. lots of ads but also gems
	   try to have your finger on the pulse. there is a lot of great information but also a lot of ads and ai slop or people who sound like they know a lot but might just be excited about something they are discovering. it's not always as good as people make it sound.
5. different models strengths
		1. showcase same prompt in different models
		   See table below [[###Table]]

6. what is a prompt engineer? (top tier sentence writers)
   control the vision. AI mostly does what you tell it to. If you don't have a vision, AI can help you develop one. But at the end of the day you need to be the driver, AI is the car.
	1. context is king
	   include details about your niche, personality, tools and technology you want to use, demographics, implementation ideas, goals, things to avoid, what you already have, what you want, the more detail the better even if it seems insignificant or obvious. set constraints
	2. research before implementation
	   you don't need to know everything but a basic understanding goes a long way. We all know eggs come from chickens but which came first? what is the physiological process of egg shell formation? AI can fill gaps and provide depth but if you don't even know that chickens lay eggs then AI is just going to output something you don't even understand leading to a gap in your professional knowledge.
	3. structure (write out your thoughts as chicken scratch, have AI interpret it then send it)
	   think of the writing process from idea -> rough draft -> first draft -> final draft. AI is the same. get your ideas written down, keep nothing in your brain because you'll forget it. have AI help you re-organize, find gaps, find overlaps. but don't let it take over your overall vision. remember you're the driver and AI is the car. 
7. Hallucinations (reality check)
   Hallucinations are less common but still an issue. Having a basic understanding of your project helps you catch errors.
	1. click every link
	   false links are still a real thing. don't go with whatever AI tells you without verification
	2. verify every fact (this is where personal understanding is key)
	   Read your AI final draft thoroughly, understand it, adapt it to your personality and project.
	3. part of the personal education process
	   Use AI to fill in your knowledge gaps to become a better professional.
8. building persistent knowledge
   Don't keep anything in your brain. How many times have you had a great thought and told yourself "I'll never forget that" and then you forget it. write down your thoughts as you have them. use a note taking app. maintain your storage in an organized and accessible way. KEEP BACKUPS.
	1. organization
	   Folders, tagging, titles, think of digital files as a paper file system. things like alphabetical, category, date created, last updated. how the hell am I going to find this again? keep your desk clean.
	2. chat history
	   Most online AI services keep a chat history. it's gotten a lot better and now "Memory" is built in to every chat bot. this is just one form of "persistence" and should not be relied on. think of your chat history as a large pool of water or thoughts.
	3. note taking app
	   Use a note taking app to keep stray thoughts but also develop more distilled thoughts, projects, and completed notes. think about ideas as mud and distilled thoughts as bricks. it takes a lot of heat and processing to get a good brick. don't throw your bricks away. use your bricks to build a foundation.
	4. storage
	   KEEP BACKUPS. things like google drive, local storage, portable drives. use it all. make backups frequently. actually learn how to use your backup system and test it. you don't want your first test run to be after an emergency.
9. showcase a comparison or workflow
	1. I'm going to use this presentation as my example and show step by step how I developed this.
