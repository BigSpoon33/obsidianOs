Great! I like more mustard than calls for---enough to coat well. I use a sweet dijon or country style dijon mustard. Homemade bread crumbs the best--you can leave more coarse. Broil the top if you want the coating more crunchy or spray tops with a pump butter spray such as "Can't Believe it's Not Butter" type---coats better than drizzling melted butter and therefore browns better. My husband hates dijon mustard and still asks for this salmon dish. It is also wonderful cold the next day for a snack or on a nice salad! Thanks for sharing the recipe! It's a KEEPER!

I modified a bit: Before mustard, I sprinkled with Penzey's spice - Ozark. Note - be generous with the mustard. And then used crushed panko breadcrumbs for a nice crunch:). Instead of butter, sprinkled generously with extra virgin olive oil. After baking, sprinkled lightly with a little melted butter, but not necessary in my opinion. And then generously sprinkled with lime/lemon juice. I also cut up chunks of tomatoes and avocado - sprinkled with salt and pepper and also squeezed with lemon lime (to marry the flavor with the salmon). I sprinkled on top. Side dish was Quinua. DELISH!

This was very good, and easy to make. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The salmon with dijon mustard is a great marriage. Actually it was not enough mustard for me so I put a little on my plate to dip the salmon in. I used honey dijon mustard. Will make again. 9-1-19.. I made this again with a few changes. I spread some honey on the fish, THEN I spread on the Dijon mustard. After the 15 minutes was up, I put it under the broiler fo 2 min to put a crust on the topping. This was really good!

This was amazing! Our absolute new favorite way to eat salmon. I had a 1.7 lb long single piece of fish, so I doubled the toppings, skipping the salt since we are trying to be lower sodium - it truly wasn't missed. I melted a whole stick of butter in a small bowl in the microwave, then added all the other ingredients (mustard too!), along with some garlic, basil, oregano, and parsley since my bread crumbs were unseasoned. Topped the salmon entirely, and baked the 16 minutes at 400 degrees, top rack, and checked. The thicker side of the salmon needed more cooking, so I flipped the foil over to cover (without touching foil to fish) the skinny side and stuck it back in the oven for about 7 more minutes. Perfection! Thanks for this great recipe! P.S. it's even better the next day.
