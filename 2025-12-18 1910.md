I have some ideas about the dashboards
give dashboards a toggle for settings that changes fields from hidden to shown. when settings are shown each section has it's settings for example water would have a way to set the bottle size. or it could be done from a settings note but that might build up and kind of be hard to find stuff. if each setting was with the section it applies to then you know what it relates to and what settings are available
a toggle button to change the css class from desktop to mobile
all using metabind to change frontmatter tags
