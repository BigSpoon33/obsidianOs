I would love to give this 5 stars for everything else, but made as written, it is exceedingly sweet, too much even for this sweet tooth. I could only eat half the bowl. I will make this again, but cut the honey way down, or use a bit of maple syrup instead. Ripe bananas are pretty sweet to begin with, so 3 tbs of honey takes it too far. Also, use ground flax instead of flax seeds, as the nutrition benefits of flax are only released when the seeds are ground. Steel cut oats can be adapted to this recipe. Keep a parcooked container of steel cuts in the refrigerator to use in place of the quick oats. Still cook as directed and they will turn out great. I love the combination of banana and walnuts in this recipe. Flavor and crunch! Thanks for sharing, Sunshine7!

I cooked it on the stove because I was making a double serving for me and my husband. I added cinnamon and lite maple syrup to taste (maybe 1 teaspoon of each?). I didn't have walnuts, but pecans were great in it. I've had almonds in my oatmeal before -- also good! I did use bananas, but you could also add apples, peaches, strawberries, whatever fresh or canned fruit you have on hand. I used half 2% and half water, and added the ground flax seed on the top after it was done cooking -- you never want to cook flax seed, as it gets lumpy and nasty that way, and I've also heard that cooks out the nutrients. Overall, a good starter recipe. Thanks!

Yummo! I eat oatmeal fro breakfast everyday, and this is gonna be one of my regular. I used old fashioned oats. I cooked the oats first for about 10 mins with half regular milk and half water. Then in the last 5 mins I added the rest of the ingredients. I used some honey ( maybe 1 tbls) and about 3 tbls brown sugar for 1.5 cups of oats so it was not very sweet. Also I added a pinch of salt. And it turned out awesome. My husband liked it too. I did grind the flax seeds and added about 3 tbls of it, as it is healthy. Well as I said it turned out yummy and not too sweet. And it will be a regular breakfast for me.

I thought this was really good. I didn't have any flax seed or walnuts on hand, so I just didn't use them. I did make changes in the amounts that I used. I took 2/3 cup of old fashioned oats, 3/4 cup of milk and I used 4 tablespoons of honey instead of 3 being I was using more oatmeal. Next time I'll use only 3 because it was very sweet, good but too sweet. I took a banana and mashed about 2/3 to 3/4 of it and cut the rest to put onto top of the oatmeal. Mixed everything together, minus the banana slices, and microwaved it for 2 minutes. Came out really good.
