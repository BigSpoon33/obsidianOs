## 🛒 Ingredients

- 4 teaspoons garlic powder
- 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 4 thick slices bacon

## 🍳 Directions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
2. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon garlic powder on each chicken breast and season with salt and pepper. Lay one rosemary sprig on each chicken breast. Wrap bacon around the chicken to hold the rosemary on. Secure bacon with a toothpick or an additional thick rosemary stem.
3. Cook chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stay near the grill to combat any flare-ups from the bacon. Remove the toothpicks before serving.

I enjoy the flavor of rosemary so I thought I'd give this a try. I had some costco bacon in the freezer which I got out at 4:00 pm for a 6:30 dinner. The bacon defrosted easy enough and the only change I did was to use fresh garlic as I don't like the flavor of dried. Just chopped it up then added a pinch of kosher salt and smashed it into a garlic paste. Put that on the chicken following the rest of the instructions. Okay, I did use a blow torch to crisp up the parts of the bacon that the grill didn't get to, but I like my bacon crispy and it was great. This is a keeper
