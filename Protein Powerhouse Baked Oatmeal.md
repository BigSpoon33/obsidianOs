It was a little on the greasy side and gummy. It lacks in flavor but I added chopped apples and nuts so dried cranberries might have made a better choice. I added flax seed and I used regular gf oats and soaked them so they would cook up. That could be the reason for the gumminess. So, all in all I think this is worth trying again and adjusting to my liking. Technically I didn't follow the exact recipe but it's a great way to get a whole meal as your heading out the door and as you can see the mistakes might have been on me.

I think this recipe was OK. I was looking for a recipe to have a quick breakfast ready ahead of the week. It definitely fits the bill. However, I found it a bit "meh". I do not know if it was because I forgot to add the milk. It was my mistake while prepping the ingredients. I guess it caused the outcome to be a bit dry and sort of bland. I will make this recipe again as I like the practicality and versatility of it. My only recommendation would be to spray the parchment with non-stick product of your choice. Parchment paper and oatmeal do not always work as expected. There are times when they do stick, so err on the safe side and save yourself a headache. I see this recipe as a good solution for the summer time to keep eating healthy breakfasts with my beloved oatmeal just without the hot temperature. I also recommend this as a good substitute to store bought sugar filled granola bars.
