### Recipe Tip

If you prefer more sauce, add additional tomato sauce, a spoonful at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.

This was very good! I had to make MASS (9 lbs of chicken!) amounts for our taco bar party and I had to figure out how to keep it warm. So, I boiled the chicken meat and shredded it like directed but instead of simmering in the pot. I combined the seasonings, onion and tomato sauce in the bottom of a slow cooker along with some garlic and a few splashes of chicken broth. I then added the shredded chicken and mixed it well. I While I prepared everything else, I set my slow cooker on 3 hours on low and let it stay on warm to keep it heated. Turned out WONDERFUL! I had leftovers in which I made a vegetable & chicken soup out of. This is versatile and can be used in lots of different things, not only some tasty tacos... Thanks Baker Bee!:)

Very good and easy to make. Read through the reviews to find Holiday Baker's comments on this recipe. It seems this was meant to be basic and adjustable to taste preferences, hence the reference to 'pinches' of dry ingredients. For 1.5 lb chicken breasts, I used about 1.5 tbsp home made taco seasoning since I ran out of chili powder. I also added 4-5 oz Herdez salsa-medium (canned) -- yes, I was out of tomato sauce too and was too tired to puree the the salsa, also thinking this would result in enough liquid. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup water. This recipe serves as a good base though for using chicken breasts for tacos instead of slow cooker. Made this dish along side "Best Spanish Rice" (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/33385/best-spanish-rice). UPDATE 2.9.18: Still making this and love it! I usually boil the chicken with 2-3 garlic cloves, 1/4-1/2 white or spanish onion (quartered), bay leaf, 4 whole pepper corns, and salt. Reserve broth to be used in other dishes. Add about 1/4-1/2 cup chicken broth to the skillet, depending on how much meat I use and if I finely shredded the meat. Otherwise, the meat might seem dry. Add more tomato sauce as needed (in a pinch use canned/jarred salsa)...you'll be able to tell if more sauce is needed as you stir all to combine. You don't want too much liquid, but don't want it dry either. This recipe remains my go to for super quick and easy chicken tacos and the versatility of it is awesome! Thank you again for the recipe!

First I make as instructed in order to give an accurate rating. It was okay, but it was bland to me. I have some suggestions for those that may feel something is missing. Use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead, it's more melt in your mouth tender and has more flavor due to it being the fatty part of the chicken. It's also not as costly as breast. Always remember the best chicken meat to add to compliment dishes that require added condiments such as this, a stirfry, or chicken casserole rice or noodle or dumpling dishes choose short thighs. It's more cost effective if you aren't a cook and keep a cabinet full of spices on hand, to just buy McCormick season package and keep them on hand. Take up less space too. I redid this using short thighs and a package of McCormick fajita season. I also used a salsa instead of tomato sauce, I added 2 tsp of minced garlic. I used my processor to finely chop a small onion. Stirfry the garlic and onion in the pan with 2 tbs of cooking oil or bacon fat until onion start to look iridescent then add cooked shredded chicken and follow McCormick packet instructions.

Definitely helps to read the comments, but I had to give it 5 stars because it was SOO GOOD and SOO EASY to make!!! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and that helped with keeping more moist. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a little salt. Then I doubled the tomato sauce, chili powder, cumin, and oil, (added a little extra onions too) as recommended by someone else, and what resulted was absolutely delicious!! I made the most amazing soft corn shell tacos with chopped cilantro en lieu of lettuce with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream. Be sure to warm up the corn tortillas on the stove a little before assembling the tacos.Definitely making this again, it was a huge hit with some homemade guacamole:)

I had a lot of gardening to do (it's July) so I put a couple of chicken breasts in the crock pot and the rest of the ingredients, it didn't seem like enough seasonings for our tastes so I added a half envelope of Old El PasoTaco Seasoning. When we were ready for dinner I put about a half cup of the shredded mixture on a large flour wrap, some chopped green onion, a small handful of shredded Monteray Jack and a few dabs of cream cheese then topped with another wrap to make Quesadillas. I put it in a hinged rack about 14 inches in diameter so it could be flipped over on the grill without falling apart. Topped with sour cream, a sprinkle of cilantro. Served with a green salad of chopped Romain, chopped tomato, sliced red onion and shopped avocado with a simple dressing. So Good and So Easy. I'm not sure who mentioned making Quesadillas with this mixture but it was a good idea, Thanks a bunch

This was very tasty and super easy. I love chicken tacos. I changed the serving size to 12, I have 2 teen boys whose stomachs are bottomless pits these days. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot since it was going to be a busy day. Because I used a crockpot I seasoned the chicken with cumin, chili powder, chicken bullion, garlic and some minced onion. Shredded the chicken up and then followed the rest of the cooking instructions. Served this with the usual toppings. Had enough to feed the boys and the rest of us with a little bit leftover for lunch. This makes awesome chicken quesadillas too! Family loved these. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe Baker Bee:)
