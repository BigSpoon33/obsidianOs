## 🛒 Ingredients

- 0.66666668653488 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup water
- 1 mango, peeled and chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 3 teaspoons honey
- 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise
- 1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained
- 1.5 cups corn
- 0.5 cup diced red bell pepper
- 1 small red onion, diced
- 0.25 cup chopped cilantro
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 0.75 teaspoon salt
- 0.25 cup sweetened flaked coconut
- 1 avocado, sliced

## 🍳 Directions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Mix mango, olive oil, lime juice, honey, Sriracha sauce, garlic, and salt together in a blender until smooth. Place chicken in a shallow bowl and pour 1/2 of the sauce on top; marinate chicken for 10 minutes.
4. Mix black beans, corn, red bell pepper, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt together in a bowl for corn salsa.
5. Grill chicken until no longer pink in center and juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat.
6. Divide rice among 4 glass meal prep bowls. Add 2 pieces of chicken to each bowl; top with reserved mango sauce, corn salsa, and coconut. Top with avocado slices, cover, and refrigerate for up to 5 days.

Made as written for the mango sauce except I doubled the recipe for 3 LBS of chicken tenders. I marinaded for 7 hours. Although excellent, next time, I will sub. vegetable or canola oil for the olive oil as I could taste the olive oil and I think a neutral flavored oil would be better. Also, I feel any type of hot sauce will work for the sriracha. I didn't use red peppers for the corn salsa, I used halved cherry tomatoes. Although good, I think some additional seasoning would benefit the flavor. I boiled corn on the cob for 3 mins. then cut off to use for the salsa. Canned corn would work too. Not sure if recipe wanted fresh, uncooked corn??? The coconut was neither here nor there, so definitely optional. Overall, as written an excellent recipe that can be tailored to your taste. I did not make this as meal prep, we ate it as a full dinner.
