## 🛒 Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 0.5 teaspoon chili powder
- 0.5 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 yellow onion, quartered
- 5 cloves garlic, pressed
- 0.5 bunch cilantro
- 0.25 cup lime juice
- 0.25 cup chicken broth
- 1 orange, zested and juiced
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, or more to taste
- 1 bay leaf
- 0.5 cup mayonnaise
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch garlic powder

## 🍳 Directions

1. Combine cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; sprinkle over both sides chicken breasts.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Sauté function. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil; sear chicken breasts in batches, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.
3. Add onion and garlic to the Pot; cook and stir until translucent and golden, about 2 minutes. Return chicken to the Pot; add cilantro, lime juice, chicken broth, orange zest and juice, 1 chipotle pepper with 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, and bay leaf. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on size of chicken breasts. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, 1 chipotle pepper with 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, milk, 1 pinch salt, and garlic powder in a blender; blend until smooth. Refrigerate sauce until ready to serve.
5. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to the manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
6. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Coat a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon oil.
7. Transfer chicken breasts to a work surface; reserve cooking liquid. Shred chicken using 2 forks; place in a large bowl. Drizzle 1/4 cup reserved cooking liquid over chicken; toss to coat. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet; drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, tossing to coat.
8. Broil chicken in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Toss chicken with 1 to 2 tablespoons reserved cooking liquid; rotate the baking sheet. Continue broiling until chicken is crispy, 5 to 7 minutes more. Serve with chipotle sauce.

## Cook's Notes:

You can use chicken thighs instead of breasts, if you like.

Leftover chipotle peppers in adobo sauce can be kept in a resealable plastic bag in the freezer.

Instead using the natural-release method to release pressure, you can also release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to the manufacturer's. instructions, about 5 minutes, if available, before unlocking and removing the lid.
