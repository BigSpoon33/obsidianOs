## 🛒 Ingredients

- 1 large sweet potato, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 eggs, lightly beaten
- 0.25 cup milk
- 1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese
- 6 large flour tortillas
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 0.75 cup cooked vegan chorizo
- 0.5 cup prepared salsa verde
- hot sauce or salsa, for serving

## 🍳 Directions

1. Gather all ingredients and preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Spread sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper and toss to coat.
3. Roast sweet potatoes until tender and browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
4. Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs and milk together in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour eggs into pan and cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until they begin to set, about 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over eggs and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until eggs are no longer runny, 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.
5. Wrap tortillas in a dish cloth and microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until pliable. To assemble each burrito: Spread about ¼ cup sweet potatoes, ⅓ cup scrambled eggs, ¼ cup black beans and 2 tablespoons chorizo in a horizontal line across the middle of the tortilla, leaving about 2 inches on either side. Drizzle with 1 to 2 tablespoons salsa verde.
6. Fold left and right sides over the filling, then tightly roll from the bottom of the tortilla to form a burrito. Tightly wrap in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining tortillas, and freeze for up to 1 month. Alternatively, refrigerate for up to three days.
7. To serve: Remove burrito from plastic or foil and place on a plate in the microwave. Microwave on high for 4 to 5 minutes, until filling is hot and tortilla is tender. Serve immediately with your choice of hot sauce or salsa. If reheating from the refrigerator, microwave on high for 1 ½ to 2 minutes.

Breakfast burritos are a favorite in our house for their quick, flavorful blast of protein and fiber. I like to use sweet potatoes for extra vitamins, but you can also roast a russet potato the same way with good results. You can also swap refried beans for black beans, and try with your favorite salsas. I always serve with plenty of hot sauce after reheating!
