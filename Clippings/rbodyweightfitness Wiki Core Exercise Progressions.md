r/bodyweightfitness Wiki: Core Exercise Progressions

## Core Progression

Note: As far as "core" exercises go, this page will forever be "incomplete". Since there are so many different things you can do for your core, we've decided to keep this page centered around the core exercises used in the [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine). For a more complete list of core exercises, please check our [exercise wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/playground).

## Anti-Extension

### Main Progression:

#### Plank

- Work up to a 30s hold then move on to your ring rollouts
- You're only doing the planks, don't do every drill in the video.

#### Ring Ab Rollouts

- Elbows should stay straight
- Remain in a hollow body position (ribs down, butt tucked)
- Keep your hands as close as your overhead mobility will allow.
- Higher ring position will make this easier. Elevating the feet will make it harder.

### Alternate Progressions:

Once you've reach a 30second plank you can choose one of alternative progression if you don't want to do Ring Rollouts:

#### Alternate Path 1:

##### Kneeling Ab Wheel Rollouts

- Use a wall to shorten the ROM and make it easier. The further you are from the wall, the more difficult it becomes.
- Keep a hollow body position (ribs down, butt tucked), brace your core, and squeeze your glutes.

##### Standing Ab Wheel Rollouts

- Use a wall to shorten the ROM and make it easier. The further you are from the wall, the more difficult it becomes.
- Keep a hollow body position (ribs down, butt tucked), brace your core, and squeeze your glutes.

#### Alternate Path 2:

##### Tucked Hanging Leg Raises

- Remain in a passive hang and a hollow body position (ribs down, butt tucked)
- To minimize swinging, keep your feet infront of your hips and pause for a second at the top and bottom of the movement.

##### Pike Hanging Leg Raises Negative

- Perform a Tucked Leg Raise then straighten your legs and perform a straight legged negative.
- Remain in a passive hang and a hollow body position (ribs down, butt tucked)
- To minimize swinging, keep your feet infront of your hips and pause for a second at the top and bottom of the movement.

##### Straight Hanging Leg Raises

- Remain in a passive hang and a hollow body position (ribs down, butt tucked)
- To minimize swinging, keep your feet infront of your hips and pause for a second at the top and bottom of the movement.

#### Alternate Path 3:

##### Pike Compressions

## Anti-Rotation

### Main progression:

#### Banded Pallof Press

- These are performed under control with a short pause when your arms are fully extended

### Alternate progressions:

#### Alternate Path 1:

##### Assisted Knee Copenhagen Plank

- Lower leg should give the minimum assistance you need.
- Don't let the hips sag.
- Can be performed on your hand instead of elbow.

##### Knee Copenhagen Plank

- Don't let the hips sag.
- Can be performed on your hand instead of elbow.

##### Assisted Copenhagen Plank

- Lower leg should give the minimum assistance you need.
- Don't let the hips sag.
- Can be performed on your hand instead of elbow.

##### Copenhagen Plank

- Don't let the hips sag.
- Can be performed on your hand instead of elbow.

##### Copenhagen Plank with Movement

- Tuck your free leg to your chest and return to neutral under control.
- Don't let the hips sag.
- Can be performed on your hand instead of elbow.

#### Alternate Path 2:

##### Ring Pallof Press

- You can adjust the difficulty by altering your straddle width. Wider straddle = easier. Narrow straddler = harder.

## Extension

### Main Progression:

#### Reverse Hyperextension

- Keep your butt tucked

### Alternate Progression Path:

#### Alternate Path 1:

##### Arch Raises

- **Only** do the lower-body raises in this video

##### Arch Body Hold

- Ok, *now* you can do the rest of the video

##### Arch Body Rocks

## Frequently Asked Questions

## How much should I rest for this triplet?

If you want to keep it simple, rest 90s between each set just like the previous pairs. If you want to save time, you can rest 30s-45s between each set.

## How do each of the alternate compare to the suggested movement?

You can look through [/u/DoomGoober](https://www.reddit.com/u/DoomGoober) 's [write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/95ribm/i_tried_every_core_triplet_alternative_my_thoughts/) comparing each path
