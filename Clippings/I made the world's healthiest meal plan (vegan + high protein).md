If you're new to my channel, my name is Leif Arnesen. I’m an engineer turned nutrition nerd and the founder of The Vegan Gym.  
  
In 2014, a rare cancer diagnosis forced me to completely rethink my life. I adopted a whole-food, plant-based diet, and a few months later, after watching Earthlings, I went vegan overnight — not just for my health, but for the animals.  
  
At first, I struggled to lose fat and get fit as a vegan. But after diving deep into the science, I built a system that transformed my body and my life. That journey led me to start a blog in 2017, which eventually became The Vegan Gym.  
  
Now, our team is on a mission to help 1,000,000 vegans get into the best shape of their lives because we believe that the more healthy, fit vegans there are in the world, the faster veganism will spread.  
  
Let’s work together to inspire change, spread compassion, and thrive on plants! 💪🌱
