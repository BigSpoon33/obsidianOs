It does that to evenly distributed the fishing line across the whole area rather than just pile it all up in one spot as you reel it in. If it just piled the line in one spot I imagine that there would be a risk of it eventually building up and slipping over one edge of the spool and getting tangled on something.

> **redmeansdistortion** • [4 points](https://reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/1pex8cb/comment/nsqyeq9/) •
> 
> That's a rear drag Abu Cardinal C series. There's a fulcrum that the knob applies pressure to, putting pressure on the drag stack. The main shaft is keyed to the white click wheel and the drag discs and washers are behind it. That particular model was on store shelves from the mid 80s to early 90s and still holds up very well. You can often find them at garage sales, flea markets, and second hand shops for cheap. On eBay, they go for well over $100, particularly the Cardinal C3 and C4 models are the most sought after. There's even a cottage industry in Japan that makes a lot of upgrade parts for them.
