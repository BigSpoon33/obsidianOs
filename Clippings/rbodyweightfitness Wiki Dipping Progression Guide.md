r/bodyweightfitness Wiki: Dipping Progression Guide

## Dipping Progression

## General Form Cues

- Straight or slightly hollow body. No bending at the hips!
- Lock out the arms and depress the shoulderblades ([what does that even mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/positioning)) at the top
- Go as far down as you can
- Elbows in

## Recommended Progression

### Parallel Bar Support Hold

- Work up to 3 sets of 1 minute holds for this progression
- [*What if I don't have parallel bars?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/dip#wiki_what_if_i_don.27t_have_parallel_bars.3F)
- If you can't hold yourself up at all, consider using bands or your feet to assist you until you gain the necessary strength.

### Negative Dips

- This exercise is only the descent. To get to the starting position you can jump or use a box or anything.
- Lower yourself with control. Work up to 10 sec descents

### Parallel Bar Dips

- See general form cues.

### Weighted Dips

- See general form cues
- You can do this progression in place of ring dips.
- We recommend to add weight to parallel bar dips first instead of ring dips.

## Alternative Progression Paths:

After you reach 3x8 Parallel Bar dips, you can choose one of these paths if you don't want to do weighted dips:

### Alternate Path 1:

#### Ring Dips

- ***Prerequisite:*** 3x8 PB Dips + 60sec RTO Support Hold (from [Warmup](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/support))
- Starting from a support position with the rings turned out, perform a dip. It's okay if the rings turn in, just make sure you turn them out at the top.
- [*What if I don't have rings?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/dip#wiki_what_if_i_don.27t_have_rings.3F)
- [*What does rings turned out/RTO mean?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/support)

#### Rings RTO Dips

- Keep the rings turned out during the *entire* dip. You will need to lean your body or pike your hips to compensate for the ring turn

### Alternate Path 2:

#### HeSPU

## Equipment

- ## What if I don't have parallel bars?
	- You can use two chairs to do dips on. Put some weight on the seats if you're afraid of them falling over. Another option is to find a counter top that makes a 90 degree angle, and do dips in that corner. You can also try to find two tables of the same height and do dips that way. Be creative!
	- If you have rings, this will be MUCH harder, but if you build up to a solid RTO support hold *first*, you might be able to safely work negative ring dips. However, it's highly recommended you find a way to do parallel bar dips before moving to ring dips for increased safety.
- ## What if I don't have rings?
	- Beyond parallel bar dips, there's not a whole lot of dipping you can do, except for weighted dips (which are a great exercise).
	- If you don't have rings or weights, we recommend you utilize the **[handstand pushup progression](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/HSPU) after mastering parallel bar dips.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Why no bench dips?

The movement pattern for bench dips is quite different due to different joint angles, which results in a very low carry over to real dips. Working on pushing strength in general with [the pushup progression](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pushup) to meet the prerequisites will accomplish the same.
