### The old recipe

A few readers have commented and emailed me asking for the old recipe I posted back in 2016. Although I no longer use this one, I’m including it here just in case you prefer that one:

- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup vinegar
- 1/4 cup isopropyl alcohol
- 20 drops tea tree essential oil (antibacterial)
- 15 drops other essential oils (to round out the scent)
### Equipment

- 1 [Large quart-sized jar with tight-fitting lid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094XNTHWS?tag=natusnurt-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)
    
- 20 [Small thin cloths](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0071H0M6C?tag=natusnurt-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) about 8-10 inches
    

### Ingredients

  

- 1 ½ cup [distilled water](https://amzn.to/2UFSlIw) distilled is best, but filtered tap water is fine for short term storage
- 1 tbsp [liquid castile soap](http://amzn.to/1DPHek0) or natural dish soap
- 10-20 drops [essential oil](http://amzn.to/2fY9ZSh) optional; antibacterial options include tea tree, thyme, and rosemary

### Instructions

 

- Add water and soap to container and stir.
    
- Add essential oils, if using and stir to combine.
    
- Add cut-up cloths to container, and press down to soak up all the solution.
    
- Cover container, and flip it upside down to ensure all cloths are saturated with cleaning solution.
    
- Use as needed for quick cleanups!
