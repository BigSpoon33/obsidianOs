These crispy grilled potatoes will pair perfectly with all your favorite summertime meals.

## How to Make Grilled Potatoes

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

Russet potatoes are the best for grilling because they’re starchy, which means they stay fluffy on the inside and crisp up nicely on the outside.

Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade grilled potatoes:

1. Poke the potatoes and microwave for five minutes.
2. Slice each potato, then microwave for two more minutes.
3. Brush the potato halves with oil, season, and grill until crispy.

You’ll par-cook the potatoes in the microwave before grilling for about seven minutes in total. This helps get them nice and tender, plus it speeds up the grilling process (so they won’t get too charred before the insides are fully cooked).

On a grill preheated to medium heat, the potatoes should be perfectly grilled after about 15-20 minutes. Remember to turn them halfway through cooking!

I have been making these for awhile now. I thought that I had developed a new way to enjoy potatoes, but now see that others have been doing this too. I take medium sized Russets, wash but leave the skin on. Then slice length wise into 3 or 4 flat long pieces, usually about 1/2" thick. I put these in a microwave safe bowl and sprinkle with salt, fresh black pepper,some garlic powder, a bit of sugar, and extra virgin olive oil. I'll leave this set for 15-20 minutes to draw out some of the moisture, and infuse the spices into the slices. Then, microwave until about 3/4 cooked, stir once in the middle of cooking. On my microwave (1100 watts), this takes about 3 minutes plus for two nice Russets. Then brown on the grill for another 5-10 minutes. I serve with sour cream, and whipped cream cheese, but lots of other toppings would also be great. These are our summer "go to" potatoes. Everyone can just take the amount they want, and not have to face a large baked potato if they don't want to.
