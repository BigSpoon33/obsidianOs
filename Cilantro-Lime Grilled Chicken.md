## 🛒 Ingredients

- 0.5 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 4 limes, juiced
- 2 tablespoons garlic salt
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 1 whole whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces

## 🍳 Directions

1. Whisk cilantro, lime juice, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken; toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 30 minutes to overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.
4. Cook on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near but not touching the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

## Ingredients

Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings

- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 4 limes, juiced
- 2 tablespoons garlic salt
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 1 whole whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces

## Directions

1. Whisk cilantro, lime juice, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken; toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 30 minutes to overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.
4. Cook on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near but not touching the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

## Cook's Note:

It's not necessary to use a whole chicken. You can use only legs and thighs to save money or whatever your local supermarket has on sale that week! This is great for skirt steak and pork as well!

If you are in a hurry, marinating is not necessary; just toss your chicken in the mixture and place it on the grill.

If you do not have a grill, bake the chicken in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) according to the recipe instructions for about 30 minutes.

## Editor's Note:

The nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of the marinade ingredients. The actual amount of the marinade consumed will vary.

1-23 18 ~I so enjoyed this, however, I made a few modifications to suit my personal taste. Rather than a whole chicken and an outdoor grill (I hate dark meat), I chose to use boneless chicken breasts and a cast iron grill pan on the stove-top. Because boneless, skinless chicken breasts are so lean, I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to the marinade to help keep the chicken from drying out as it cooked. I forgot the garlic salt and didn’t miss it. In fact, now that I look at the recipe again, the amounts indicated for both the garlic salt and the pepper seemed waaay overload so I’m glad I missed the garlic salt and used the pepper to taste. The final result was just delicious, especially since I accompanied it with a tomato avocado salsa I made with the recipe Avocado Salad, also from this site. Hubs is not a fan of either cilantro or avocado, so the fact he was out of town allowed me to make this and to enjoy what I probably would not have tried otherwise!

Needs improvement

I made this as written and it was sooo salty we could hardly eat it. Even my Partner that loves salty food thought it was too much. The garlic salt overpowers the lime and cilantro so you don’t really taste that too much.I knew the black pepper was going to be too much so I just added 1 tsp. and that was fine but the garlic salt was way too much at 2 Tablespoons so I think it should be 1 tsp. too.I want to taste the lime and cilantro with this chicken, I mean after all, that is the name of this recipe.So I will try it again with my modifications because I love marinaded grilled chicken. By the way, we made it with thighs and roasted cauliflower with hollandaise sauce.
