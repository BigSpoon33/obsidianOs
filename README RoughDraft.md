Ok so this obsidian vault is build primarily using datacore and some other community plugins

DO NOT DELETE SYSTEM
but if you do don't panic. the vault is built in a way that the system folder is removable. just replace the folder and your vault will work again.

All of the .jsx and .css files are in the system folder. The system folder will eventually hold all of the template, base, and maybe category and dashboard files. basically anything you don't want accidentally deleted. 

Everything else goes in the root folder. this is kind of important, kind of not. It's just a preference thing. when everything is in the root it is just easier on the mind, you don't have to think about putting things into folders. because instead of a folder structure we use templates with tags. for example if you want to make a new recipe note it goes into the root with everything else but it is not lost because the recipe templates is tagged with the category recipe so you can always find it through a search or dashboard.

This is my current UI.

I'll start from the top left we have a button that toggles the side pane

On the left edge we have some quick buttons like the quick switcher, graph view, new canvas, insert template, etc. 

At the top left are buttons for the file browser, search, bookmarks, and notebook navigator. 

Just below that is the new note, new folder, sort order, reveal current file, and expand/collapse all. 

At the top middle we have the tabs for open notes and things like canvas or graph views. 

just below that is the main window pane. this can be split vertically or horizontally to show two tabs side by side. 

At the top left of the window pane is a previous/next arrow buttons, 

you can have line numbers, 

the top right is a reading/edit mode toggle and the 3 dots. 

And on the sides we have side bars. 

The side bars are actually the same as tabs more or less. You can drag many tabs from the window pane to the side bar and vice versa. for example the image on the right is just a note tab that is open to the .gif saved in my vault. 

on the bottom left sidebar we have a few tabs that show up as buttons. you can add or remove to these by dragging in or out. you can also right click -> close. 

we have and outline or table of contents for the current note, space repetition community plugin, recent files, agenda view,

at the top right sidebar we have more buttons or tabs for things like a monthly calendar. 

On the bottom right sidebar we have some more custom tab space and it's currently a 1-2 depth graph view of the current note as well as a pomodoro timer. at the bottom left you can switch between vaults and there is the settings cogwheel.
