## Slide 1
Hello, today I'm going to be giving a presentation on the buzzword of the century, 'AI'. This is a basic introduction to what AI is and how to use it. 

## Slide 2
AI is basically a word calculator. It uses high-speed math with a massive vocabulary to predict the most probable next word. The idea and math has actually been around for a long time but we just recently have computers that are able to run it.

## Slide 3
AI has many real world use cases for things like re-writing angry emails into a calmer tone, doing market research, highlighting key points from documents, and brainstorming.

## Slide 4
One of the golden rules of AI is garbage in, garbage out. AI is a multiplier for your knowledge. Don't fall into the lazy 'write an essay about x' approach. AI needs your context, specific data, and personality to get a quality tailored output.

## Slide 5
One of the buzzwords in AI is 'Transhumanism'. Working with AI to develop and improve your human skills. AI is not a replacement, it's a collaborator. It's important to keep a human in the loop who has at the minimum a general idea of the goal.

## Slide 6
You can think of AI like a digital intern army. You maintain the highest level thoughts and plans while utilizing AI to execute tasks. There are two primary concepts for AI usage. The agent is similar to a personality with a job like a librarian, project manager, or researcher. The workflow is a repeatable set of instructions. Open the fridge, grab a soda, open it. Used to automate tedious tasks. 

## Slide 7
AI moves fast. There is always a new SOTA model coming out or a tool someone made. Let other people weather the storm to work out bugs while you implement more stable tools. The first step when implementing AI is to get to a minimal functional product. This can look like a single personal assistant agent and a day planner workflow.

## Slide 8
Execution without strategy is like throwing spaghetti at the wall. Context is king. Provide as much detail as possible in your initial prompts. You are the driver, AI is the car.

## Slide 9
AI works best if you have a strong foundational knowledge of your topic. You don't have to know everything but you need to understand the overall jist of things. We all know chickens lay eggs but do we know the physiological process of shell formation? Start with chicken scratch and distill your thoughts into high level notes.

## Slide 10
Reality check. AI hallucinates, it's a gaslighter, it's very confident even if incorrect. You have to be the overseer. You have to click every link and check every fact.

## Slide 11
AI services like gemini or chatgpt or claude save your chats which is good for history and context but at the end of the day you need a note taking app or method that saves stray thoughts and distilled high level information.

## Slide 12
TAKE BACKUPS! do fire drills. you don't want your first run to be when there is an actual fire. Maintain digital privacy and ownership.
