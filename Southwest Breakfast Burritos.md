We took out the jalapeños as the spice level wasn’t great for breakfast but we have been making these for about 3 months now and here are a few changes we made. Cut the jalapeños and use Tex mec cheese Double the recipe - they freeze well and it’s quite time consuming to roll and wrap so save yourself some time by batching these. We roll them and then wrap in foil before freezing because it holds shape and keeps them tight. If you have an air fryer that’s our preferred way to reheat in the morning We did half bacon and half sausage because... bacon. 6 inch tortillas were way too small and we found rolling was easier with bigger ones. You can add potato if you want a heavier breakfast.

These are delicious. I scaled down to only make a few as that's all the tortillas I had. They were small tortillas labeled as fajita size, so they were easier to fold over into tacos rather than a wrapped up burrito. I cut one in half, but it unwrapped. It was actually burrito style. There was too much tortilla at the bottom end for me though where it was folded up. I liked the flavor of these. I used diced Hatch green chiles from the jar, the 505 ones, so they are medium heat and already roasted. I chopped that onion really fine so I wouldn't bite into a piece as I have an aversion to the texture not the flavor. Same with that tomato. I mashed it into tiny bits. I used garlic powder and skipped the cilantro since it tastes like dish soap to me. This made a nice easy breakfast. I didn't freeze mine though. We just cooked and ate them. I did have to heat them in the microwave for about 30 seconds starting from room temp. I'd just keep checking them if I were starting from frozen as my microwave may not be the same wattage as the recipe poster's and I don't want to overcook them and have rubbery tortillas.

After reading comments, made a couple of very minor changes. I added 1 cup of 1/2" diced cooked potato--next time will use more. Since 1/2 onion is an imprecise measurement, I used 1 cup, diced, which I sauteed with the sausage and garlic. Amount of jalapeno was perfect for us as the can I opened was relatively mild--I'd considered using a can of green chilis and some pepperjack cheese, but with the jalapenos, stuck to cheddar. Always taste your pepper--cautiously--as they can vary widely in heat. I skipped the taco seasoning which is mostly salt anyway. I never use milk in scrambled eggs, so didn't this time--my eggs were big, so there was plenty of volume. My tomato was large, too--almost 2 c diced. I also used a bit more cilantro, about 1/3 c, and might use even more next time. Another time I might try Mexican style chorizo, which will up the spice level. 6" tortillas are hard to roll and still include enough filling, so I used 1 dozen 8" tortillas. Still plenty for the freezer--but they didn't last long! I had sour cream and both red and green salsa for garnish. Yum!
