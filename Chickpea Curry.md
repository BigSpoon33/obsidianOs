Yes, I made this dish, but I did not follow the recipe exactly. Here are the modifications I made: 1. The recipe does not call for curry powder, so I added 1 tbsp of it. 2. The recipe calls for 2 onions. I would not recommend using 2 onions for only 2 cans of beans, it would be too much. I only used one onion and that was PLENTY. 3. I would never use the juice from canned food for anything. I drained the beans, rinsed them, and peeled the outer layer off before putting them in the pot to cook. Instead of using the can juice, I used 1 cup of vegetable broth. 4. I used 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon instead of 2 sticks. I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon. 5. I did not use cloves because the store didn't have them. With these modifications, the dish came out absolutely delicious!

2015.07.12 - Per other reviewers: 6 whole cloves = 1/2 tsp ground clove, 1 inch cinnamon stick = 1 tsp ground cinnamon, added one can undrained diced tomatoes to 1/2 recipe and drain (homecooked) chickpeas, crushed 1/4 to 1/3 of the chickpeas with a spoon as they cooked. Left out the cilantro for DBF's sake. Served with turmeric rice (1.5 cups rice sauteed on medium in 1 Tbs butter for two minutes, add 3/4 tsp turmeric & 1/2 tsp salt, add 3 cups water and simmer approx. 10 minutes (still medium)). This was okay, but it was a little bland with a good aftertaste. (No, my spices aren't old.) Maybe double spices next time and accumulate them in a small bowl as the onions cook. 2015.02.29 - Doubled all dry spices except cayenne (used 1/2 tsp cayenne). Used 1 tsp salt. Used butter instead of oil. Added one can diced tomatoes with juices. Cooked in ceramic skillet. Still no cilantro for DBF.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time, and I have been making it for years for my family. Sometimes, though, the spice as written can be a bit too hot for younger members of my family, so a tablespoon of mild curry blend actually was a better fit for my family than the turmeric, cumin, and coriander. All other spices I kept exactly the same. I would wager that those who argue that this is not flavorful enough are being impatient and throwing everything into the pot at once. Dishes like this need to have the flavored layered. Don't skip steps. Also, cilantro takes on a bitter flavor when heated. I wouldn't add it to the pot at all. Finally, in our house, this is a complete meal served over jasmine rice and topped with cilantro and a dollop of yogurt.
