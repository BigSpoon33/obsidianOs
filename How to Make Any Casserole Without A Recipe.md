We have lost our off-the-cuff casserole traditions. As home cooks become more and more committed to printed recipes and to guide their cooking practice, suddenly [casseroles](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/249/main-dish/casseroles/) have left the realm of "toss all the with something creamy and bake" spontaneity and have become no different than any other recipe, with ingredients to be sourced or techniques to master.

But the act of tossing together what you have on hand is really empowering as a cook—not to mention so much easier, because you learn that you can swap ingredients in or out as you choose, even adjusting to your own taste and dietary preferences. To make any casserole from scratch—no recipe required—here's what you need to know to succeed.

## The Secret to Making A Casserole Without A Recipe

The trick is mastering a basic ratio of what to include in a casserole. Once you do that, you can riff endlessly. Like the musician who takes the time to memorize scales and key signatures so that they can improve a solo, getting a general idea of how casseroles come together means that you can have a lifetime of unique dishes ahead of you and your family. You may find that you never really make the same one twice!

Choose your own adventure! Use this basic ratio to extend leftovers into a satisfying second meal. With this method, you can make casseroles out of almost anything. (Note: Serves 4-6.)  

- **1 cup chopped aromatics** (any combo of onions, celery, bell peppers, carrots, fennel)
- **3-4 cups cooked protein** (ground or chopped meat, canned fish or canned beans)
- **2-3 cups carbs** (cooked pasta or rice or grains, shredded or cubed raw potatoes)
- **1-2 cups vegetables** (raw, cooked, frozen or canned)
- **1-2 cups sauce or binder** (canned condensed soup, white sauce, cheese sauce, gravy, simmer sauce, sour cream)
- **Seasonings** to taste
- **1 cup topping** (cheese, toasted breadcrumbs, crushed snack ships, nuts, or a combo)
1. Heat your oven to 350 degrees F and grease your vessel.
2. In a large bowl, combine the aromatics, protein, carbs, and vegetables and season well with salt and pepper, and any other spices or herbs you might want to add.
3. Add one cup of your chosen binder, and then mix well. If it seems dry, add more binder until you get the consistency you like. You can use a combo, for example, a can of condensed soup along with some sour cream, or a half and half mix of white sauce and gravy.
4. Once the mixture seems like it has enough saucy stuff to effectively bind and flavor it, pour into the prepared dish and top with your chosen topping.
5. Bake for 30 minutes, then check the temp, and (if needed), doneness of any raw ingredients. Continue to cook until all ingredients are fully cooked, the casserole is bubbling around the edges, and the topping has your desired browning.  
	  
	Reduce the oven heat to 200 degrees if you need to keep the casserole warm until dinner time.

## Tips and Tricks for Making Casserole Without A Recipe

  
A is standard, but you can always make a casserole in a or **skillet** if that is easier. You can choose to layer ingredients or, simply, mix them all together.  

- If your casserole contains **all pre-cooked items**, then you are just needing to bake long enough to heat everything through.
- If you have any **raw items** like vegetables or potatoes in it, you will want to be sure to test those items for doneness before serving.
- If you are **making a casserole ahead of time** to chill and reheat later, leave off the topping until you are reheating, or whatever you are putting on top will get either soggy (crumbs or chips) or leathery (cheese).
- If you like casseroles for their last-minute magic, be sure to with some helpful staples like **canned condensed cream soups** (mushroom and chicken are common, but celery is also a great one), **breadcrumbs** (regular is fine, but think about panko for extra crunch), **noodles** of various shapes and a variety of **[rices](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/best-rice-recipes/) or grains**, and **canned and frozen proteins** like beans, tuna, and salmon, or vegetables like pearl onions, chopped broccoli, and more.
