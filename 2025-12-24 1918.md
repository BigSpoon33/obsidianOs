That is the spirit! 🎨 Building one element at a time is the best way to master Datacore.

To answer your question about **"what other creative artistic aspects can we play with?"**, here is a menu of techniques we can use in future widgets:

1. **Glassmorphism (Frosted Glass):** Using `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` to make backgrounds look like blurry glass over your wallpaper.
    
2. **3D Transforms:** Using `transform: perspective(1000px) rotateY(180deg)` to make cards flip over or buttons tilt when you click them.
    
3. **Masking:** Using `mask-image` to cut elements into shapes (stars, hexagons) instead of boring rectangles.
    
4. **Blend Modes:** Using `mix-blend-mode: overlay` to make text interact with the background colors (like Photoshop layers).
    
5. **Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`):** Creating multiple borders, glowing orbs, or "shine" effects without adding messy HTML.
