I'm starting to have a deeper idea about managing daily notes. we can use datacore, similar to how we make the journal widget that can quickly flip through previous days. we do the same thing for the daily note. the daily note becomes a log for frontmatter values and the daily console becomes our view for daily notes. does the daily note console trigger the period notes tag or does it just make it's own system? for example if daily note not created there is a button to create it and you don't even have to go to it because the console finds today's note and loads the frontmatter into the datacore widget.
